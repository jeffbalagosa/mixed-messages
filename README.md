# mixed-messages

This is the repo for the "Mixed Messages" project on the Codecademy full stack developer course.

## Project Objectives:

- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

## Prerequisites:

- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line

## My Plan

- Random Phrase Generator
  - Every time it's ran it will print a phrase to the console.
  - The phrase itself will be randomized.
  - There will be at least 1 noun and 1 verb within the phrase that'll also be randomized.
  - Similar to mad libs
